   Facing a scenario where you have a high chance of dying without chance of survival is less stressful 
         than a situation where you might survive. Why is this? Because it’s less complicated.


   We've got to figure out what we know we don't know. To do that, we've got to confirm what we know we know.
      But there's always a chance, once we figure out what we know we know and what we know we don't know, 
                  that we won't know what we don't know, which could be a problem.
